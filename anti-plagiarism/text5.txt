Pubs (short for Public Houses) grace almost every street and are known for their traditions and heritage. They date back to the time of the Roman occupation in England, when the Italians had their taverns ['tæv(ə)n] in which they would drink alcoholic beverages and socialize. When the Anglo-Saxons were in command, they had alehouses, which served a similar purpose. A pub is a unique place because there are no similar bars or cafes ['kæfeɪz ] in other countries A pub is a place like home where people come to meet, learn the latest news, and just chat. Nobody will be told off for noise, exclamations, and even shouting there.                                                                                                                                                        Beer is the most commonly drunk beverage at pubs. In addition to ale, pubs stock various wines as well as brandy, whiskey, gin, and so on. Nowadays customers can be offered a various menu of hot dishes and snacks as well. Most pubs offer only special English meals, which is quite cheap. However, drinks are quite expensive.                                                                                                                All pubs are built in a particular style. Even if it is a newly built pub, it is often designed to look as if it were about several hundred years old. All the windows in the pub are small in order to make a cozy home atmosphere. Very few pubs have tables outside the building. This peculiarity came from the Victorians who thought that people must not be seen drinking. On the other hand, many pubs have a garden at the back for children because children are not allowed in most pubs. Moreover, there still exist very few pubs where it is surprising for a woman to walk in.                       Another distinctive point of pubs is that there is no waiter service. Some people may consider that a  strange way of making people feel comfortable, but British people are sure that being served at a table makes the visitors be reserved and unnaturally polite. Therefore, when coming to a pub, the first thing a man has to do is to lean on the bar and wait for someone to be served. Eye contact and "smiling eyes" become a key to being served faster. The staff is usually very friendly and jesting. They know all the regular customers personally, their preferences in food and drinks. It makes the atmosphere very relaxed and informal. All the staff is always ready to chat and take part in any sort of discussion.                                                                                                                             By law, pubs can only open at 11h00 and can only serve drinks until 23h00. Nobody under the age of 18 is allowed to consume alcohol in Britain.
